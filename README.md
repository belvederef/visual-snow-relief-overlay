# Visual Snow Relief Overlay

This experimental project stems from the conjecture that the prolonged exposure to static noise (e.g. TV static) is useful at reducing the symptoms of the [visual snow condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow).

Several people have reported that watching static noise "freezes" their visual snow symptoms and allows to gain clear vision, although only for less than a minute on average. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=800f9UNiF4Y) is quoted by many as providing this result. The static noise could be able to stimulate the areas of the brain that cause visual snow and trigger a response.

Try to relax while you look at your screen through the static. Many people suggest they were most successful managing the symptoms of Visual Snow when practicing meditation and relaxation. **If looking at the static makes you feel dizzy, stop immediately.**

The project was created as a response to a number of requests posted on the Reddit website, where it was asked for such a tool to work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. See [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/jlwpae/working_on_a_program_that_overlays_your_screen/), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/jzgjs0/improved_foss_visual_snow_screen_overlay_for_vs/), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyInformatica/comments/jrprun/fare_due_soldi_e_aiutare_chi_soffre_di_visualsnow/) for more.

## What is Visual Snow?

[Excerpt from the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) [article](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/)]  
Visual snow is a neurological disorder characterized by a continuous visual disturbance that occupies the entire visual field and is described as tiny flickering dots that resemble the noise of a detuned analogue television. This "static" is typically black and white but can also be colored, flashing or transparent.

In addition to the static, or snow, patients can experience additional visual symptoms of either direct neurological origin, such as palinopsia (either in the form of preserved images from stationary scenes or as visual trailing), photophobia and nyctalopia, or the entoptic phenomena.

The causes of visual snow syndrome are currently unknown. Some key features of the syndrome however, point to a neurological disorder of visual processing in the brain cortex.
